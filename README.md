## Split your bill with fun

### Overview
When a group a friends go out to eat or drink, often in the end they need to split the bill. One person pays the total amount and the rest send the money to that person. 

In my culture, often friends take turns to pay for the group. It's a way to keep the group active. So I was thinking to make an app that chooses one person to pay based on facial emotions. For example, the group take a photo and the person with least surprised face will pay this time. I did a little bit twist to this idea in this project. 

The rule in this project is, the person with the MOST superised face, for example, doens't need to pay! Lucky! And the bill will be splitted by the rest. And also the app will choose a person that handles the total bill and collets payments from others, and generate a QR-code that can be used directly with mobile bank apps.
